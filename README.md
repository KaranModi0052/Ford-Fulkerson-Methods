# Ford-Fulkerson-Methods #


## Containing Files ##

1) Aug_Path.py // contains all the 4 variation algorithms and has logic for Ford Fulkerson algorithm
2) Source_Sink_Graph_Generator.py // contains all the graph creation logic
3) main.py // single file to run and execute all the logic of the project and will give outuput in tabular format.
4) Generated Graphs

## Steps to run the code ##
The code is tested working in 3 platform:
- Google Colab
- Local Machine
- Computation.encs.concordia.ca server

-> It works fine everyewhere.

***  Steps to Run  ****
1) If running in local machine just print (in cmd)
- python main.py

2) If running on computation.encs server:
- python3 main.py

3) Google Collab 
- paste all 3 codes into single cell of the notebook and hit run

## Tweaking Parameters ##

If you want to chang the values of n, r,maxCap you can change that in the by passing that into main.py which has a list of data. You can add your own [n,r,maxCap] and you are good to go.

As per the project description and to show minimal output of the code the values from the same data field some values are commented if needed please uncomment it and run the code to execute it. 


## Output ##
As per the input of [n,r,maxCap] one file containing graph will be created in the same directory and the output can be seen in the CLI as a tabular fom as a matrix which will have all the values required as per the project description. 


## To Verify ##
I have added screenshots of current running execution so it can be easily verified with the generated values as the first value of the graph contains the values of given n, r, maxCap, etc.
